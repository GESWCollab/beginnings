# Beginnings
This is just a playground to get familiar with what you need for the other course we are working on. This is meant to be a place to learn, test coding, help each other, and above all else HAVE FUN! It could be said that the number one skill you need as a modern developer is how to effectively use source control.  As git (and GitHub) are the most widely used tools in modern development, investing the time to become a power user of these tools is critical for your success. I hope you enjoy the tasks and embrace the platform for a different type of collaboration.

  First things first lets make sure you have a Github account. Click [HERE](https://github.com/join) to get a github accont. Be sure to chooose a name you want to be around forever and also to secure it with a good password.
  
  Now that you have an account what can you do with Github? Well thats a little out of scope for what we are doing however [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart) is a good guide to get started with Github. 
  
  Since you have Github installed and spent 3 whole minutes perusing the qucikstart guide before being bored you are now ready for a installing some software. 
  
  The first thing we need if we are going to be working with code is a code editor. For the sake of this work we will be using Vissual Studio Code. There are quite a few code editors oout there and whiel they are all good and customizable we will be using Visual Studio Code for our work. If you want to look into some other vode editors I have compiled a few other options for you.
  * [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) A good editor from Adobe BUT they are discontinuing it in Septemeber of this year.
  * [Atom](https://atom.io/) Another really cusstomizable eidtor and this one is made by Github.
  * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) Windows only editor that has a cult following and gets love from everyone for being a great free editor.
  To install Visual Studion code you click [HERE](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) and follow the platfrom specific instructions.
