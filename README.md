# Beginnings
This is just a playground to get familiar with what you need for the other course we are working on. This is meant to be a place to learn, test coding, help each other, and above all else HAVE FUN! It could be said that the number one skill you need as a modern developer is how to effectively use source control.  As git (and GitHub) are the most widely used tools in modern development, investing the time to become a power user of these tools is critical for your success. I hope you enjoy the tasks and embrace the platform for a different type of collaboration.
